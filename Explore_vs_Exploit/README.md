- Upper Confidence Bound (UBC)
- Tompson Sampling

### About the data:
The data represents 10 different adds run over 10000 different times. 

|Ad 1|Ad 2|Ad 3|Ad 4|Ad 5|Ad 6|Ad 7|Ad 8|Ad 9|Ad 10|
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|1|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|1|0|
|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|
|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|
